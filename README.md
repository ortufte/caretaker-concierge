## Description

Caretaker Concierge is a CRUD, MVC app that allows users to organize and keep track of their dependents whom rely on them. Once the user logs in, they are welcomed by a dashboard which displays all of their dependents and each dependent's activities. A dependent can be a child, a spouse, an elderly parent, a pet, the options are endless. Once you create an activity for a dependent, that information is displayed on your dashboard and easily printed out to hand off to another caretaker in the case of an emergency or travel. It contains the necessary information that they would need to quickly begin caring for your dependents effectively. Activities could include sports, classes, feeding schedules, nursing home facilities, dog walking schedule, a spouse's work contact information, home maintenance contacts, etc! Again, the possibilites are enless.
